# DL-Image-segmentation
DL image segmentation is a data-driven technique that divides images into meaningful segments using deep learning algorithms. This approach involves gathering and preprocessing image data, selecting suitable neural network architectures like U-Net or FCN, training the model on annotated images, validating and fine-tuning it, and ultimately utilizing the trained model for accurate image segmentation. By automatically identifying and delineating distinct objects or regions within images, DL image segmentation enables applications such as object detection, medical image analysis, and autonomous driving, leading to improved decision-making and enhanced visual understanding of complex scenes.
